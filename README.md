# life_avatar
This is an app that contains life counters from different competitive trading card games.


Roadmap: 
1. Allow users to register an account and login
2. Allow users to select which life counter/game they would like
    2a. I'm going to start with 4 games
3. Allow users to select the number of players using the game
    3a. for example, whether they are playing alone or with someone else.
4. Users should be able to see past game data and the outcome of that game
    4a. For example, they will see which game they played and who won
